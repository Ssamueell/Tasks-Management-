# Tasks-Management-
A simple task management system
This is a simple task management application built using Python, designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks with options for adding, viewing, removing, and marking tasks as completed.

Features:
Add New Tasks: Users can add tasks with a title and description. Tasks are initially marked as "Pending".

View Tasks: A list of all tasks is displayed, showing the title, description, and current status (Pending/Completed).

Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list after confirming the removal.

Mark Tasks as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed, changing their status to "Completed".

Save Tasks: The task list can be saved to a tasks.json file, preserving the data even after the application is closed.

Interactive Console Interface: The application operates in a simple, user-friendly text-based console interface where users can choose options and perform actions.

How it Works:
Adding Tasks: Users input a task title and description, and the task is added to the list with a "Pending" status.

Viewing Tasks: Users can view the current list of tasks with their respective details.

Removing Tasks: Tasks can be removed by selecting the task number from the list, with a confirmation step to avoid accidental deletion.

Completing Tasks: Users can mark tasks as "Completed", which will update their status.

Saving and Exiting: Tasks can be saved in a tasks.json file for later retrieval, and the application will exit after saving.

This task management application provides a simple yet effective way to keep track of personal or work-related tasks, all while being easy to use and manage.
